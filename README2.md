## Static Site architecture
Because the content in a static site doesnt have to be processed on a request basis it can be served completely from a servers cache, or a cheaper cloud based object storage solution like AWS s3. 

To have fast response times globally, https, amongst several other percs you can add a CDN (content distribution network) that fetches contet the origin (s3 bucket) and distributes it to several edge locations scattered around the globe. This places the content a lot closer to the end user and hence faster response times.

## How it Works

## Pricing
When using Arjan Tools you are using your own AWS account from your own machine.

Any charges incurred by your websites will be billed from AWS to you. 

Arjan Tools does not have any access to your AWS account or bill.

## Pricing breakdown
This is a breakdown of the costs of hosting a static site in AWS

Letâ€™s say your website uses CloudFront for a month (30 days), and the site has 1,000 visitors each day for that month. Each visitor clicked 1 page that returned a single object (1 request) and they did this once each day for 30 days. Turns out each request is 1MB for the amount of data transferred, so in total for the month that comes to 30,000MB or 29GB (1GB = 1,024MB). Half the requests are from the US and half are from Europe, so your monthly total for data transferred comes to $2.47. Also, each click is an HTTP request, so for the month that equals 30,000 HTTP requests, which comes to a total of $0.02 for the month. Adding the two values together, the total cost for using CloudFront for this example would be $2.49 for the month.

- cloudfront
  - 29GB bandwith = 2.47$
  - 30,000 http requests = .02$
- Route53 .50$
- S3 5GB storage = 0.15$
## total - 3.14$
